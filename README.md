# README: ID3 Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This project implements the **ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) Algorithm**, a decision tree learning algorithm used in machine learning for classification problems. The `ID3ALGORITHM.ipynb` notebook walks through data preprocessing, tree construction, and decision-making processes.

## Features
- Implementation of the **ID3 Algorithm** for decision tree learning.
- Calculates **information gain** for attribute selection.
- Builds a **decision tree** from labeled dataset examples.
- **Classifies new data points** using the trained decision tree.
- Visualizes decision tree structure.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for programming.
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding.
- **NumPy & Pandas** for data handling.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization.
- **Scikit-learn** for dataset manipulation.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ID3ALGORITHM.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to load data, compute information gain, and build the decision tree.
3. Test the model with sample data points.
4. Modify dataset and hyperparameters to experiment with different results.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement **pruning techniques** to improve decision tree accuracy.
- Extend to **multi-class classification problems**.
- Compare ID3 with **C4.5 and CART algorithms**.
- Integrate with **real-world datasets** for practical applications.
